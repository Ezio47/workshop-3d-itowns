# Potree Viewer

Potree Viewer is a web viewer for point cloud data. It has many features, including measuring tools and configurable visualization.

The point cloud of a subset of the city of Montreal is available at this address: http://3d.oslandia.com/potree/examples/lopocs.html.

You can access the options with the top-left menu button.

We recommend changing the point styling ("materials" menu) to "Classification" for a better viewing experience.

## Navigation

To navigate in the point cloud use:
* The mouse's left button to rotate
* The mouse's right button or the keyboard's arrow keys to translate the camera
* The scroll wheel to zoom in and out

## Filtering

You can filter points by type in the classification filter menu.

Try removing ground and high vegetation to only see the buildings.

## Measurements

Open the tools menu.

You can try various measuring tools. Left click to measure and right click to cancel. From left to right:
- Angle measurement
- Point coordinates retrieval
- Distance measurement
- Area measurement
- Volume measurement
- Height profile
- Volume clip (colors all the points in a volume)
- Remove all measurements

The measurements menu shows information on the current measurements. You can access the height profile 2D representation this way.
