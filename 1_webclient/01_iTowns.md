Introduction
------------

iTowns2 is a JavaScript framework for the visualization of 3D geospatial data.

We will use it to view terrain, 3D buildings and point clouds.

Running iTowns2
-----------------

A running example is available at http://3d.oslandia.com.

The top left panel can be used to show or hide the different layers of the demo.

Holding the "s" key and clicking on a building displays its attributes.
