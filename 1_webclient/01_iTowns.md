iTowns

Introduction
------------

iTowns2 is a JavaScript framework for the visualization of 3D geospatial data.

We will use it to view terrain, 3D buildings and point clouds.

Running iTowns2
-----------------

A running example is available at http://3d.oslandia.com.

The top left panel can be used to show or hide the different layers of the demo.

Holding the "s" key and clicking on a building displays its attributes.

Your own 3D scene
-----------------

On the server, in the home directory of the user 'foss4g', a subdirectory named 'www' can be found. It contains one subdirectory for each user of the workshop.

* Creates a file /home/foss4g/www/wsXX/index.html with a simple text content ("Hello !") and checks that it is displayed correctly when you go with your browser to 3d.oslandia.com/foss4g/wsXX/

* TODO explain how to copy the example
