## Content

The workshop is based on the following technologies:

* [PostGIS](http://postgis.net/): the well known database, with 3D and point cloud additions
* [MapServer](http://mapserver.org/): a Web Map Service server
* [iTowns2](https://github.com/iTowns/itowns2): a 3D web client to display 3D data in a browser, based on WebGL, Three.js and PoTree
* Oslandia's [building server](https://github.com/Oslandia/building-server)
* [Greyhound](https://github.com/hobu/greyhound): a point cloud server

The workshop is composed of three modules:

* Data: importing geospatial data from different sources into a postGIS database
* Web client: an introduction to the iTowns web application and the PoTree viewer
* Analysis: 3D analysis using postGIS and visualization of the result with iTowns

In each module, steps are marked with a number, allowing you to follow easily the whole training session.

## Environment

This workshop requires a recent web browser with WebGL support and a good graphic card.

You will also need an SSH client to access the remote database.
