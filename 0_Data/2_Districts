# Districts

We will now import the districts of the city, stored in a GeoJSON file, into our database.

The districts are represented geometrically by a 2D polygon.

## Importing the data

The ogr2ogr program allows us to load all of the data contained in the GeoJSON file in our database.

Choose a name for your table. We will refer to it as "district table"

`ogr2ogr -f "PostgreSQL" PG:"dbname=gml user=postgres" "/home/oslandia/data/montreal/geojson/district.json" -nln <district table> -append`

We can check the result:

```
psql gml
SELECT num, nom FROM <district table>;
```

You should see 34 districts in the table.
