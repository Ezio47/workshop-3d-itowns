# Naming convention

In this module, you will be brought to create two tables, one for the buildings, one for the districts.

To avoid conflicts between users and simplify some steps, you should choose the name of the table in the following way:

* For the building table : wsXX_montreal
* For the district table : wsXX_districts

With XX being your assigned number.
