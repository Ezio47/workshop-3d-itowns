# Buildings

Our building data is contained in CityGML files.

Here are the instructions for extracting the geometries from the files and importing them into a postGIS database.

## Preparing the database

We need to create a new table for the buildings.

Choose a name for the table, we will refer to it as "building table" in the rest of the workshop.

`psql gml -c "CREATE TABLE <building table>(gid SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, geom GEOMETRY('POLYHEDRALSURFACEZ', 2950))"`

## Importing the data

We use the citygml2pgsql script to extract geometries from cityGML files into SQL queries.

You can safely ignore the warnings.

`citygml2pgsql /home/oslandia/data/montreal/gml/data/pmr/PMR01_2013.gml 2 2950 geom <building table> | psql gml`

* /home/oslandia/data/montreal/gml/data/pmr/PMR01_2013.gml is the CityGML file to parse
* 2 is the level of detail that we wish to load
* 2950 is the SRS of the data
* geom is the name of the column that will contain the geometry
* <building table> is the name of the table in which the data will be imported

This process can be pretty long. To save some time, the other SQL scripts have already been created.

`sh /home/oslandia/data/scripts/load_citygml.sql <building table>`

You can check that the data has been correctly loaded:

```
psql gml
SELECT count(*) FROM <building table>;
```

The result should be 80127.
